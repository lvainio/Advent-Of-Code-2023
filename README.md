# Advent Of Code ⭐⭐

This repository contain my solutions to Advent Of Code.

## Usage

The program automatically retrieves the problem input, and therefore requires the Advent of Code session cookie. To use it, retrieve the session cookie from your browser and set it as an environment variable `AOC_SESSION`. In Windows it can be set with the following command:

```bash
setx AOC_SESSION <your_session_cookie_here>
```

Build the project with the following command:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

Run the program with following Maven command with the `-year` and `-day` flags to specify the year and day of the puzzle:

```bash
mvn exec:java -Dyear=<year> -Dday=<day>
```
